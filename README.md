# Ad-Performance-Prediction-and-Optimisation-using-Deep-Learning


## Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict advertisement performance and optimise ad spend in real time. It analyses historical engagement data, audience interactions, and ad creatives to improve click-through rates (CTR), conversions, and budget allocation.

The model integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based ads and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for sequential ad performance data. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques are used to dynamically adjust bid prices and optimise budget distribution across campaigns.

## Key Features
Ad Performance Prediction: Uses deep learning models to estimate CTR, conversion rates, and audience engagement.
Creative Analysis: CNNs analyse ad creatives to identify patterns in high-performing visuals.
Sequential Data Processing: LSTMs track user interactions over time to improve ad targeting.
Reinforcement Learning for Optimisation: Implements dynamic bid adjustments and budget allocation to maximise ROI.
Fraud Detection & Anomaly Analysis: Identifies potential ad fraud and click anomalies using statistical and ML-based methods.
